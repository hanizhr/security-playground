# Mobile Security Playground ðŸš€

> A practical project for learning mobile app security (Android APK analysis) while building a small Django-based dashboard to host and present results.  
> Focus: learning-by-doing, creating portfolio pieces, and producing shareable analysis reports.

## Project summary
This repository is a learning playground that combines two connected goals:
1. **Learn practical mobile application security** â€” static and dynamic analysis basics, threat discovery, and how to document findings.  
2. **Build a simple product** â€” a Django web app that accepts APK uploads, runs analysis jobs, and shows results in a clear, downloadable report.

The emphasis of this README is the **roadmap**: clear weekly milestones and deliverables so you can progress steadily and end with portfolio-ready work. Technical implementation details are intentionally light here â€” add them later as you build.

## High-level goals (end of the program)
- Practical experience analyzing Android APKs (static and basic dynamic checks).
- At least three small, well-documented analysis reports suitable for a portfolio.
- A working Django application that accepts uploads, runs an analysis workflow, and presents results.
- A Docker-friendly project structure and a brief deployment guide.
- A clear README, sample reports, and demo media (GIFs/screenshots) for interviews.
